Copying CSS files to WebApp assets...
Copying Javascript files to WebApp assets...

The total size of your local CSS and JS files is 2.2MB and another 0.3MB in other assets.

If you are using public frameworks (like jQuery, Bootstrap, etc...), consider using their CDN so the browser can use already buffered versions.
Done!
